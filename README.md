# Gun-Script
A script I am designing to be versatile and usable with all and any guns without external scripts, except for player movements
<br>
For the code to work propperly please follow these steps.
1. Download/Copy the **gun** code into your unity project
    - [Get the code](https://github.com/Belistov/Gun-Script/blob/main/ShooterCode.cs)
2. Download/Copy the **health** code into your unity project
    - [Get the code](https://github.com/Belistov/Gun-Script/blob/main/health.cs)
3. Put the **gun code** on your **gun**, and the **health code** on your enemy
